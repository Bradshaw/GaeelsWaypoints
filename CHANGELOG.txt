CHANGELOG

1.0.0 (06/30/2014):
- Waypoint icons can now have durability values
- Waypoint access permissions changed to use an underscore in place of spaces
    Ex. "&6The Nether" would have a permission of "wp.access.the_nether"
- Stopped waypoint menu from opening for waypoint locations which the player doesn't have access
    Menu always opens at spawn, but players need "wp.access.spawn" for it to show up in other menus

0.9.5 (06/29/2014):
- Right-clicking with a renamed clock (through anvil) while sneaking will create a home waypoint
- Right-clicking on a home waypoint while sneaking will set the waypoint's icon to player's item in hand
    If this item is a written book, the contents of the book will become the waypoint's description

0.9.2 (06/27/2014):
- Waypoint names and descriptions now have configurable length limits; menu lore now wraps as needed
- Rather than remove it from the menu, the active/selected waypoint is now marked
    Active/selected waypoint is prefixed by a green star; cannot be selected
    Instead of showing selected waypoint in /wp, player's home waypoints are shown instead

0.9.0 (06/26/2014):
- Home waypoints can now travel to Spawn, Bed, and other home waypoints
- Players now "snap" to waypoints when using them
- Added /setspawn; each world's spawn is now a waypoint (menu only shows current world's spawn)
- Granted all non location-based commands to CONSOLE
- "/wp select" now brings up a selection menu, allowing for player-defined waypoint editing
    Menu includes server-defined waypoints for players with "wp.admin" and access permissions
    Lists server-defined waypoints in Console when no arguments are passed
    Server-defined waypoints can be specified in arguments
- Renaming waypoints now properly checks for duplicate name
- Removing waypoints now removes its selection from players
- /sethome default lore is now configurable under SETHOME_DEFAULT_DESC
- Corrected "/wp icon" usage error message
- Access permissions are now "wp.access.<name>" instead of "waypoints.access.<name>"
- Added CHANGELOG.txt
