CHANGELOG

1.2.0 (07/14/2014):
- Added respawn handling, which is configurable in config.yml
    Players with "wp.respawn" permission can set their respawn point to a home waypoint by right-clicking one
    while sneaking and holding a Waypoint Beacon (both beacons and respawn handling must be enabled)
- Added sound effects to teleportation and interactive home waypoint configuration
- The maximum amount of home waypoints is now configurable in config.yml as "MAX_HOME_WAYPOINTS"
- Config.yml is now properly saved with defaults for new options
- Added wp.toggle as child permission to wp.admin

1.1.0 (07/07/2014):
- Waypoints can now be enabled/disabled with "/wp toggle"
    Disabled waypoints will show up in list as disabled
    Players with "wp.bypass" permission will still be able to travel to disabled waypoints
- Added item "Waypoint Beacon"; recipe is a compass in the center of a workbench surrounded by redstone
    Players with the permission "wp.beacon.use" can right-click while holding it to open directory
    "wp.beacon.server" will allow players to see server-defined waypoints with the beacon
    "wp.beacon.unlimited" will prevent the beacon from being consumed on use
    Players with "wp.select" can left-click with it to select waypoints
    This feature can be disabled in the config.yml
- Added discovery mode
    "/wp discover" will toggle discovery mode for selected waypoint
        "Server-wide" will allow discovered waypoints to show up globally
        "World-specific" only allows discovered waypoint to show in its own world
        "Disabled" disables discovery mode
        Accessing waypoints in discovery mode will grant players access to it; disabled by default
- Instead of scaling and being capped at displaying 54 waypoints, directory is now a fixed size
    Added paging and navigation buttons in directory to allow for an unlimited number of waypoints
- Fixed bug that allowed player to drop items from directory under rare circumstances

1.0.0 (06/30/2014):
- Waypoint icons can now have durability values
- Waypoint access permissions changed to use an underscore in place of spaces
    Ex. "&6The Nether" would have a permission of "wp.access.the_nether"
- Stopped waypoint menu from opening for waypoint locations which the player doesn't have access
    Menu always opens at spawn, but players need "wp.access.spawn" for it to show up in other menus

0.9.5 (06/29/2014):
- Right-clicking with a renamed clock (through anvil) while sneaking will create a home waypoint
- Right-clicking on a home waypoint while sneaking will set the waypoint's icon to player's item in hand
    If this item is a written book, the contents of the book will become the waypoint's description

0.9.2 (06/27/2014):
- Waypoint names and descriptions now have configurable length limits; menu lore now wraps as needed
- Rather than remove it from the menu, the active/selected waypoint is now marked
    Active/selected waypoint is prefixed by a green star; cannot be selected
    Instead of showing selected waypoint in /wp, player's home waypoints are shown instead

0.9.0 (06/26/2014):
- Home waypoints can now travel to Spawn, Bed, and other home waypoints
- Players now "snap" to waypoints when using them
- Added /setspawn; each world's spawn is now a waypoint (menu only shows current world's spawn)
- Granted all non location-based commands to CONSOLE
- "/wp select" now brings up a selection menu, allowing for player-defined waypoint editing
    Menu includes server-defined waypoints for players with "wp.admin" and access permissions
    Lists server-defined waypoints in Console when no arguments are passed
    Server-defined waypoints can be specified in arguments
- Renaming waypoints now properly checks for duplicate name
- Removing waypoints now removes its selection from players
- /sethome default lore is now configurable under SETHOME_DEFAULT_DESC
- Corrected "/wp icon" usage error message
- Access permissions are now "wp.access.<name>" instead of "waypoints.access.<name>"
- Added CHANGELOG.txt
